Project Title:COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
Project Description:

In this project,it is a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends.
The project analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. 
It looks clean and processes real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools. 

 Project Objectives:

✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report 

 Tools:
Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension) 
pandas 
matplotlib
seaborn
Plotly Express

Any insights or reflections
1. Vaccination Inequality
We observed significant disparities in vaccination rollout — high-income countries like the US and India vaccinated large portions of their populations rapidly, while countries like Kenya lagged behind, possibly due to access or infrastructure challenges.

2. Data Quality Matters
Metrics like total_vaccinations can be misleading when used without context — we saw cases where total doses exceeded population size. It’s important to distinguish between:
Total doses administered
3. Visual Tools Are Powerful
Charts like choropleths and pie charts offered intuitive understanding of global trends, disparities, and progress that would be difficult to grasp from tables alone.
